# TEAMx Recipes

Common recipes and cookbooks intended for TEAMx use.

# Cookbooks

## Mapping

Recipe book for making maps using cartopy, google image tiles, and SRTM elevations. 
Includes several helper functions that could be wrapped into a separate helper 
function if useful.

Includes the conda environment used to make the maps.

## Data

1) SRTM tiles (.hgt files) for the TEAMx study area. Also converted to netcdf. The SRTM data are "Version 3" and fills many of the voids over areas of complex terrain that existed in previous versions. See the [documentation](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/srtmgl1v003/) for more details. Data were downloaded from the [STEP portal of ESA](https://step.esa.int/auxdata/dem/SRTMGL1/).
2) All site locations for the TEAMx pre-campaign in csv format.

## Helper functions

See separate README.
